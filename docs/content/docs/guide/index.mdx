# Introduction

Welcome to **Neptu** — where ancient Balinese wisdom meets modern blockchain technology.

## What is the Wuku Calendar?

The Wuku calendar is a 210-day cycle used by the Balinese people for centuries. Unlike the Western calendar, it focuses on spiritual energy patterns rather than seasons.

### Key Cycles

| Cycle          | Days   | Purpose                                          |
| -------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sapta Wara** | 7      | Like weekdays (Redite, Soma, Anggara, etc.)      |
| **Panca Wara** | 5      | Market cycle (Umanis, Pahing, Pon, Wage, Kliwon) |
| **Wuku**       | 30 × 7 | 30 wuku periods, each 7 days                     |
| **Sad Wara**   | 6      | Six-day spiritual cycle                          |

### URIP Values

Each day in each cycle has an **URIP** (spiritual energy number). These combine to reveal:

- **CIPTA** — Your psychosocial traits (how you think)
- **RASA** — Your emotional patterns (how you feel)
- **KARSA** — Your behavioral tendencies (how you act)
